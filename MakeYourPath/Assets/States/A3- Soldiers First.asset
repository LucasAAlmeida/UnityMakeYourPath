  storyText: 'After a minute calling around, one trembling voice answers. The soldier
    is in his last moments, a terrible slashing wound in his chest pump out his life
    blood.

    You hold his hand, trying to comfort him, and he whispers "The goblins
    went to the north... I fought the leader..." *coughs blood* "I managed to hit
    him on his right leg, but it wasn''t enough... Follow the goblins... Save the
    merchant..."

    He dies in your arms.


    1- Follow north, sword in hand.

    2-
    No way, this is above my paycheck. Flee south.'
