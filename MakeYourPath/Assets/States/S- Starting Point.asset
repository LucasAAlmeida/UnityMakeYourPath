  storyText: 'Welcome to the Make Your Path game!


    You are a soldier, one of
    several that were hired to protect a merchant from one town to the other.

    One
    day like any other in your journey, a bunch of goblins sprung a trap and your
    fellow soldiers fell one after the other.

    You yourself fought brilliantly,
    sometimes fending off 2 oponents at the same time.

    However, one goblin caught
    you from behind and clubbed your head, instantly knocking you out...


    You
    will be faced with decisions, which you can make by using the 1, 2 or 3 keys
    in your keyboard.


    Can you make it to the end alive and well? Good luck!
