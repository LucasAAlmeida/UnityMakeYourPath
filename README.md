Player: Last surviving soldier of a caravan escorting a merchant.
Goal: Rescue merchant kidnapped by goblins.

A choose your own adventure-esque game.
My focus with this project was to use scriptable objects to create various states of game.
The Game Manager only loads in the first state, then lets the states progress by themselves. (Each state knows it's following states)

This game can be expanded simply by creating more "State" cards, and chaining them in a way that makes sense for the story.
